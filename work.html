  <h3> SUMMER 2019: Girls Who Code Teaching Assistant @Jet.com</h3>
  <div class = "card1">

</div>
  <p> This past summer, I worked as a TA at Jet.com for Girls Who Code! It was
  an amazing experience meeting the newest generation of innovative women curious
  about technology. Imposter syndrome is a true reality for many women considering
tech. When I did this program in 2017, I was empowered by the idea that women and other
URM'S are entitled a place in areas of industry they are passionate about. This summer, I wanted
to give back. Over the seven weeks, I taught seventeen high school girls Python,
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and databases. I helped maintain relationships with partner
company contacts and speakers to facilitate engaging class discussions.

  <p> My interests in biotechnology began when I worked in the Tsien Lab at NYU.
  I saw how electrical engineering technologies had the ability to provide functional
recovery to patients with brain damage. </p>
  <p> To combine my interests in computer science and
  biology, I work as an economic analyst for Cornell's premier biomedical engineering
  project team. I help conduct patent searches to asses the uniqueness of proposed projects
  and generate a general market impact analysis</p>
<h3> OCT 2019 - PRESENT: Business + Logistics Sub-team Member @Cornell Concrete Canoe </h3>
<div class = "card4">
<img class = "card-1" id ="canoe" src = "canoe.png">
</div>
  <p> Surprised that a concrete canoe can float? I was skeptical, but my friend encouraged me to apply to the team.</p>
  <p>
    Soon after, I joined the "floating boat nerd club"
    as a business and logistics subteam member. Here, I have the opportunity to express
    my creativity in front-development to build our team's website. Our subteam works to
    maintain connections with sponsors and host fundraisers to support our nationally-ranked team.
  </p>
  <p> Fun fact: Concrete is 30% less dense than steel! </p>
